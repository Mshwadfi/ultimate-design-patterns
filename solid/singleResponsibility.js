// The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that
//  a class should have only one reason to change, meaning
//   it should only have one responsibility or purpose. In essence,
//    a class should focus on doing one thing well.


//here the order class violates the single responsipility,
// itâ€™s responsible for both handling payments and sending notifications.
//  If the notification method changes (e.g., switching from email to SMS),
//   the Order class must be modified, which is unrelated to 
//   its main responsibility of managing orders.

    constructor(orderId, amount){
        this.orderId = orderId;

    proccessPayment(paymentMethod){
        console.log(`Processing payment of $${this.amount} using ${paymentMethod}`);

        console.log(`Sending notification for order ${this.orderId}`);
    }
}

const order = new Order(1, 3);
